The “They Know” project is a harmless Python-based demonstration designed to display local system information and browser history in a fun, spooky, full-screen interface.

Important Notes:

It does not transmit any data over the internet.

All information remains on your local machine.

It is fully safe to run, and no personal data is shared with any third party.

Browser history is accessed read-only and only from local files.

Exit safely at any time by pressing ESC.

This project is intended for educational or entertainment purposes only, to simulate a “spooky hacker” experience in a safe environment.
